Charlotte County, FL

Gray Quarter, Inc. has upgraded the agency scripts extracted from the BOCC Production environment from 2.x format to the newest scripting 3.0 format.   The original scripts that were stored in standard choices have been migrated into JavaScript files, using the Accela best practice directory structure.   These standard choices have been converted to a structure that mirrors the record type structure for the agency.
